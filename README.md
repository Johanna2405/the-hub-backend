# The Hub Backend

## Overview

the hub is a productivity web app developed as a graduation project at WBS CODING SCHOOL.

Inspired by the idea of a digital second brain, the hub helps users and communities capture, organize, and connect their thoughts in one central place. Whether it's posts, tasks, bookmarked content, or calendar events â€” the hub gives you a unified, distraction-free workspace to manage your ideas and daily flow.

The backend provides APIs to support the frontend application, handling data storage, user management, and business logic. It is built with a focus on scalability and maintainability.
